My project Book Attic is an E-commerce for selling books online (hard copies or e-books) where you can handle orders easily, add coupons and add products for your customers.
I designed a mockup then I had to achieve certain criteria that were given to me, I will mention the most important ones that my E-commerce should have to be successful:
- Responsive on all screens.
- Translation option.
- SEO and Security plugins
- Registration before making the payment.
- All the URLs must be SEO friendly.
